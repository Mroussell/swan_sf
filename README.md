# Solar Weather ANalytics for Solar Flares

An Analysis, Modeling, and Prediction project that takes the SWAN-SF NASA Dataset and preforms these functions to see if Solar Weather can be used to Predict the occurance of Solar Flares.

## Purpose

This repository can be used to learn how to analyze, model, and decide on a dataset with complex business logic.
In combination with some outside research and following these notebooks, you can figure out how to go from knowing nothing of data science, to having a base understanding of how to take a data project from start to finish.

I hope this is helpful to whoever may see it.

## Set-up

To reproduce these analysis, models and predictions, follow the Jupyter Notebooks in order step by step. 
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) installed and set-up to begin.
